abstract: "Neuropsychologists commonly use the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test as a test of the integrity of frontal lobe
functions. However, an account of its range of validity
and of the neuronal mechanisms involved is lacking. We
analyze the test at 3 different levels. First, the different
versions of the test are described, and the results obtained
with normal subjects and brain-lesioned patients
are reviewed. Second, a computational analysis is used
to reveal what algorithms may pass the test, and to
predict their respective performances. At this stage, 3
cognitive components are isolated that may critically
contribute to performance: the ability to change the
current rule when negative reward occurs, the capacity
to memorize previously tested rules in order to avoid
testing them twice, and the possibility of rejecting some
rules a priori by reasoning. Third, a model neuronal
network embodying these 3 components is described.
The coding units are clusters of neurons organized in
layers, or assemblies. A sensorimotor loop enables the
network to sort the input cards according to several
criteria (color, form, etc.). A higher-level assembly of
rule-coding clusters codes for the currently tested rule,
which shifts when negative reward is received. Internal
testing of the possible rules, analogous to a reasoning
process, also occurs, by means of an endogenous autoevaluation
loop. When lesioned, the model reproduces
the behavior of frontal lobe patients. Plausible biological
or molecular implementations are presented for several
of its components."
